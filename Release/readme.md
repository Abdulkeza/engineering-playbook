#### How to Release

- Create release notes as per the [guide here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).
- See [release template here](.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md).
- **Versioning:** our versioning will following the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) convention:

  ```
  Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  ```
