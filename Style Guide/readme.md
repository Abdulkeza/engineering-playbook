### Code Style Guide

Everyone writes code a little differently. As a team, we have decided to agree on how we write codes.

The following style guides would help us ensure uniformity in the way we write codes.

##### CSS:

- [BEM CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/andela/engineering-playbook/tree/master/5.%20Developing/CSS%20Naming%20Convention)

##### JavaScript:

- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

##### React:

- [React esLint file](https://goo.gl/6ADSZb)
- [React Style Guide: Airbnb React Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)

##### Typescript:

- [TSLint Config for Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-config-airbnb)

> **Tip on Linters:**
> Each of the above style guides will most likely have a linter (and it's IDE plugin/extension), make sure you install it to make things easy for you; for instance [ESLint for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). And also add it as part of your build process. See a [compiled list here](https://github.com/AndelaOSP/awesome-linters).
