This section includes our general guidelines on how we communicate.

## Slack Etiquette / Best Practices for Communication

- Don't use `@channel`, use `@group-name` if possible or `@here` before `@channel`
- Slack Reactions are your friend. Always better than adding a new acknowledgement message if it can be solved with an emoji reaction that's clear
- **Technical Support:**
  - _Taking ownership_ - when users and other stakeholders raise questions or raise issues on Slack, any team member can respond, and don't have to wait for the TTL.
  - _Being polite_ - when a user reports an issue, it's important that you acknowledge for caring to do that in the first place. This makes them feel comfortable. So something like `Hi [Stakeholder's name], thank you for raising the issue.`, etc, is good.
  - _Timelines_ - it's very important that you keep your word whenever you promise to get back to a user. For instance on Slack, you could use the _remind_, _star message_ or _mark as unread_ features to help you follow up. For urgent bugs, it's important that users get regular feedback on what is being done so far (preferably every few hours).
